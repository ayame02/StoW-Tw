        "'Little duck, little duck, dost thou see, \n Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee. \n There's never a plank, or bridge in sight, \n take us across on thy back so white.' \n The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. \n 'No,' replied Gretel, 'that will be too heavy for the little duck. She shall take us across, one after the other.'"
