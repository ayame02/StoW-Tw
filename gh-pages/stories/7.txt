Sometimes, getting over pain and betrayal means Getting Up, Getting Even and Getting a Better Man.

Astrid has planned out her perfect wedding. That is before she found out that her fiancé, Bryan, is cheating on her with her cousing-slash-best-friend-slash-maid-of-honor, Geena. And worse, Bryan got Geena pregnant.

Just when Astrid thought it couldn’t get any worse, she received a wedding invitation telling her that her wedding will happen exactly the way she planned it. Except that she is no longer going to be the bride!

So when her parents urged her to attend the wedding “as family”, she planned the perfect revenge. She will put on a show for everyone to see. She’ll show them that she moved on with a better man—handsome, smart, rich and crazy about her. She’s even willing to pay a guy to be her “Knight in Shining Armani”.
