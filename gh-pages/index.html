                    The Little Mermaid dwells in an underwater kingdom with her widowed father (the sea king or Mer-King), her dowager grandmother,
                    and her five older sisters, each of whom had been born one year apart. When a mermaid turns fifteen,
                    she is permitted to swim to the surface for the first time to glimpse the world above, and when the sisters
                    become old enough, each of them visits the upper world one at a time every year. As each returns, the
                    Little Mermaid listens longingly to their various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings.

                        Astrid has planned out her perfect wedding. That is before she found out that her fiancé, Bryan, is cheating on her with
                        her cousing-slash-best-friend-slash-maid-of-honor, Geena. And worse, Bryan got Geena pregnant.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story_description">Just when Astrid thought it couldn’t get any worse, she received a wedding invitation telling her that
                        her wedding will happen exactly the way she planned it. Except that she is no longer going to be
                        the bride!

                        crazy about her. She’s even willing to pay a guy to be her “Knight in Shining Armani”.

                    Crimsons survive off essence. They're a proud breed who coexist with Spirit Sifters, Witches and Humans, until their beast
                    escapes. When Sofia meets Kai for the first time she is left wondering exactly what he is, for although
                    he shares a similarity with the Crimson race, he is clearly different. Kai...well, his blood is toxic,
                    and not only to Supernaturals but to Humans also. Always controlled through submission, the Guardians
                    have managed to keep him a secret for centuries, but there is so much more to the innocent beast than
                    what meets the eye.
